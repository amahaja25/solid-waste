# final-project

<strong>4/13</strong> --
For my final project, I want to make a news app that displays data about solid waste violations in Maryland based on data from Maryland's Open Data Portal. Maryland's website should be updated each day, so that means my news app should keep up with the most recent violations and be updated everyday. One record would be one of the violations, which is one row in the csv.

I think the hardest part will be getting the text from the pdfs using tesseract. Getting the actual data isn't very hard as it is already available for me to export and is structured in the way I want it, so I won't be spending so much time figuring out how to scrape it. But I do want to figure out how to make the text of the violations searchable, because I think that would be the most useful part of this app. 

I don't think I want to make any part of this data not searchable. Earlier, I did think about narrowing down the news app to focus on certain violations rather than others, such just focusing on hazardous waste violations, but I think having all of the violation types would be better since they are all parts of the larger solid waste program in Maryland, so it makes sense to keep them all together. I want each violation to go to its own page, and I was also thinking about having each type of violation have its own page so I could provide additional context on what they mean. Based on the data, there are 8 solid waste program categories, so maybe a page for each of those? <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/">This</a> news app is structured in a way I like. Though the ProPublica news app is on a much larger scale with more individual ways the allegations are split up and the context of it is obviously very different, just the same concept of having the home page display the sections and then each page displaying just the filtered data for that criteria is something I want to do.
